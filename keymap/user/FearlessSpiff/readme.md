### Thanks
Thanks to this beautiful piece of software my laptop keyboard behaves almost like my loved 40% Mechwild Mercutio keyboard!
### Features
* Switch between "Default Pimped" Dell keyboard layout and almost 1:1 Mechwild Mercutio [fearless_spiff](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/tree/master/keyboards/mechwild/mercutio/keymaps/fearless_spiff) layout with F12.
* Check .kbd for details...
* Everything besides mouse control behaves like described on my [fearless_spiff](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/tree/master/keyboards/mechwild/mercutio/keymaps/fearless_spiff) qmk layout.
